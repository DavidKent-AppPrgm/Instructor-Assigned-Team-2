Instructor Assigned Team #2 - Kiosk Simulation System - CS-3443-001-Fall-2019-Applications Programming



---Read Me---

This project has been tested to work when imported into the following IDEs:
1. Eclipse
2. IntelliJ IDEA

This project uses the Java 8 SDK and its included JavaFX libraries. In order to build it,
you will need those libraries.

The project can be run within those IDEs via their standard toolbar, or by building the jar
executable and running it. The Kiosk application requires two files for persistence
between runs: Accounts.txt and Products.txt. It will create these files in its
working directory if they do not exist; otherwise, it will read them in. Make sure
the program has write access to the directory it's running in, or else it will not
be able to list products or accounts.


Here are the default accounts you can use to log in:

Default Admin Testing

-Username =Admin -Password =Admin

Default Employee Testing

-Username =employee -Password =employee

Default Customer Testing

-Username =customer1 -Password =customer1

Another admin testing

-Username =dkintx -Password =password

all account information is stored in Account.txt same goes for products in Product.txt
